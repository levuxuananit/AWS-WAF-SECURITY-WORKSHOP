# SECURITY PILLAR - WELL-ARCHITECTED FRAMEWORK
### Security Pillar Workshop
Welcome to the [Security Pillar]() - AWS Well-Architected Framework workshop.
In a cloud computing environment, security is not only a top priority but also a key factor that determines the sustainable success of the system. That is why the Security pillar is one of the six main pillars of the [AWS Well-Architected Framework]() - a set of guidelines built by AWS to help organizations design and operate workloads securely, efficiently, and in accordance with compliance requirements.

The **Security pillar** focuses on how you protect data, systems, and resources in the cloud. It includes strategies for access control, identity management, data encryption, event monitoring, and security incident response. Following AWS recommendations in this pillar not only helps reduce risk, but also increases your ability to detect and respond quickly to threats.
