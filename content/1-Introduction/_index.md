![WAF](/images/1.Introduction/WAF.png )
 **The AWS Well-Architected Framework** helps you understand the trade-offs of the decisions you make when building workloads on AWS. By using the Framework, you will learn current best architectural practices for designing and operating workloads that are reliable, secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable in the cloud. It provides a way to continuously measure your workloads against best practices and identify areas for improvement. We believe that having well-architected workloads significantly increases the likelihood of business success.

This framework is based on six pillars:
- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency
- Cost Optimization
- Sustainability
