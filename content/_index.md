# AWS Well-Architected Security Workshop
### Security Pillar Workshop
Welcome to the workshop on the [Security Pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html) – part of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.
In the cloud computing environment, security is not only a top priority but also a critical factor that determines the long-term success of a system. That is why the Security Pillar is one of the six core pillars of the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/?wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-order=desc&wa-guidance-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&wa-guidance-whitepapers.sort-order=desc) – a set of best practices developed by AWS to help organizations design and operate workloads that are secure, efficient, and compliant.

The Security Pillar focuses on how you protect data, systems, and resources in the cloud. It includes strategies such as access control, identity management, data encryption, event monitoring, and incident response. Following AWS recommendations in this pillar not only reduces risk but also enhances the ability to detect and respond quickly to security threats.
